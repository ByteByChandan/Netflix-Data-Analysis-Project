  <h1>Netflix Data Analysis Project</h1>

  <p>This project explores Netflix's content library using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It provides an in-depth analysis of movies and TV shows, uncovering trends in genres, countries, release years, and the most frequent contributors, such as directors and actors. The analysis aims to give insights into content distribution, production trends, and user-centric features such as ratings and keyword-based searches.</p>

  <p>The dataset contains details for each title, including a unique ID, title name, type (movie or TV show), director and cast, country of production, date added to the platform, release year, rating, duration, and genres. This data enables exploratory queries such as counts of movies versus TV shows, top countries by content contribution, yearly content additions, genre frequency, ratings breakdowns, top directors and actors, oldest and most recent titles, longest duration movies, content distribution per country, and keyword-based searches.</p>

  <p>The analysis is implemented using Python with Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. Users can reproduce the analysis by cloning the repository, opening the notebook <code>Netflix_Data_Analyst.ipynb</code> in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code, installing the required libraries, and running the notebook step by step.</p>

  <p>Some example insights include that the US and India typically contribute the largest number of titles, TV shows have grown faster than movies in recent years, and ratings like TV-MA and TV-14 are common across the catalog. The project is licensed under the MIT License, and the notebook can be extended for additional queries, visualizations, and deeper analyses.</p>
